# Documentation Playbook Factory

## Introduction

Welcome to our Documentation Playbook Factory! This guide is designed to help you produce consistent documentation that is easy to read, understand, and use. By following the guidelines outlined in this playbook, you can ensure that your documentation is professional, accurate, and consistent in tone, voice, and formatting.

## Target Audience

Before you start writing your documentation, it's important to define your target audience. This will help you choose the appropriate tone and voice for your documentation, as well as determine the level of technical detail that you need to include.

Our target audience includes developers, technical writers, project managers, and other stakeholders who are involved in building and using our products and services. We assume that our readers have a basic understanding of programming concepts and terminology.

## Tone and Voice

Borrowed from [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/top-10-tips-style-voice) and [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/digitalocean-s-technical-writing-guidelines)

1. Friendly but formal

- do not include jargon, memes, excessive slang, or emojis.
- Use second person to keep the focus on the reader and what they'll accomplish (e.g., "You will configure..")

2. Define acronyms and project-specific terms upfront

If you're using acronyms or words that the general audience may not understand, you should define these upon the first use. Then, you can use the acronym in subsequent writing.

**Example**
Sway introduces a new type called Address, which could represent an EOA (externally owned account) or a smart contract. EOAs are the most common type of account.

2. Use bigger ideas, fewer words
   Shorter is always better.

**Example**
Replace this: If you're ready to purchase Office 365 for your organization, contact your account representative.

With this: Ready to buy? Contact us.

3. Write like you speak
   Read your text aloud.

Does it sound like something a real person would say? Be friendly and conversational. No. Robot. Words.

**Example**
Replace this: Invalid ID

With this: You need an ID that looks like this: someone@example.com

4. Lead with verbs
   Most of the time, start each statement with a verb. Edit out you can and there is, there are, there were. To learn more, see Verbs and Word choice.

**Example**
Replace this: You can access apps across your devices, and you get online file storage and sharing.

With this: Store files online, access them from all your devices, and share them with coworkers.

## Formatting

To ensure consistency in formatting, we recommend using the following headers and tags:

1. H1: Documentation Playbook Factory
   Use H1 to indicate the title of your documentation playbook.

2. H2: Introduction
   Use H2 to introduce your documentation playbook and provide a brief overview of what readers can expect to learn from it.

3. H2: Target Audience
   Use H2 to define your target audience and provide information about their technical background and knowledge.

4. H2: Tone and Voice
   Use H2 to describe the tone and voice you will use in your documentation.

5. H2: Formatting
   Use H2 to describe the formatting guidelines you will follow in your documentation.

6. H3: Subheadings
   Use H3 to divide your documentation into sections or subtopics.

7. Bold
   Use bold to highlight key terms or concepts.

8. Code blocks
   Use code blocks to display code snippets or examples.

9. Bulleted and numbered lists
   Use bulleted and numbered lists to organize information into easy-to-read chunks.

## Visuals

To make your documentation more engaging and easier to follow, we recommend using visuals such as diagrams, screenshots, and videos. These can help illustrate complex concepts or provide step-by-step instructions.

When using visuals, be sure to include alt text and captions that provide context and describe what the visual is showing.
